    Square 1:The Beginning
    <br>
    While I was walking back to my dorm, 
    I had this idea: 
    what if we put ourselves into a Linear Algebra free world and show Dr. Shirley how painful that would be?
    I pitched it to Nancy, and, 
    due to our occasionally matching stupidity, she aborded this ship(贼船) of mine.

Square 2: Plotting
<br>
The story basically writes itself. The main goal is to illustrate how inconvenient the world can be if linear algebra is out of the picture. 
Ever from the very beginning, we wanted the time machine to be involved (mainly because I wanted to showcase my very basic understanding on time traveling).
So with that being settled, we did not rush to do our research on linear algebra. Instead, we tried to make our story more... enriched.
To make our story more logical, we thought about the origin of the time machine, and because Mr. Senak looks too much like a mad scientst, we casted him and made him the source (without his permission) immediately.
But he was kind enough to take the job with no payment :).
<br>
Then we moved on to the ending, we were fancinated by the idea that maybe our world can be a gaint matrix. We thought that each and everyone of us can be a vector, a possiblity in the span of our world. 
Deleting some of us would make it inconsistent, and everyone of us have the equal chance of being the crucial vector that cannot be deleted, since our matrix is forever changing and moving.
Yet with experimenting with this idea on paper, Nancy found it to be poorly supporting our notion.
With hope, we asked Ian for advice, he suggested that we make our matrix infinite size, so that we are all pivotes. 
It is from that moment, I knew the name of our film has to be Pivotal.

Square 3:Handling Disappointment
<br>
It is when we first started editing, we realized, it is impossible for us to get things perfectly the way we wanted.
A lot of scenes are extremely stupid, and we did not deliver 
the right tone or facial expression.
But we did not have ample time for something that can reach our starting expectation anyways. 
At least our story is intact, at least our story is intact, we kept telling ourselves that.
<br>
<br>
Square 5: Making sense of everything
<br>
WE CANNOT COME UP WITH A HAPPY ENDING!!! But we did eventually start to do research on real-life examples of applications of linear algebra.
It is kinda scary how much less we would have if we did not exploit linear algebra to our current extent.
I'd have no game to play, to start with.

The bits that I found most unpleasant is the ones that we traveled back to
