<h2>Props and other random stuffs</h2>
<p>In our story, this is the letter the U.S. soldier wrote to his wife during the WWII 
    - we used it to deduce what had happened back then. Nancy had tried to make her hand-writing not so Nancyish (well at least she tried...)</p>
    <br>
<p>This is the cover page of the time traveling manual that we found in the <del>washer</del> time machine. Inside is filled with practical knowledge of how to time travel that Chloe would publish sometime in the future.</p>
<br>
<p>The children's park<br>
    ... This is where we originally planned to film the "inside the washer" scene. Though we eventually gave up this setting, we had a great time there :))

<h2>Disappointments</h2>
    <br>
<li>The audio sometimes only comes in one ear.</li>
<li>The pound is filled with lotus leaves so we cannot skip stones there</li> 
<li>Chloe's </li>
<li>videos taken at night are sooo blury!</li>
