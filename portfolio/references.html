        I've always loved CSA as a band. I even have a few of their records. 
        Their musics are my go to songs before bed.
        So...I'm basically 夹带私货. 
        Even though I'm biased when it comes to their music, this one does its job nicely in the film.
        Moreover, we are very happy about the fact that it is called apocalypse, which matches the plot that we brought apocalypse to the world for like thousands of times.

        As you can see, the idea here is to display all the times we messed up in a really fast clip.
        Ever since I got inspired by "Everything, Everywhere, All at once", I wanted to do a chaotic scene that has us traveling from dimensions and timelines rapidly.
        I originally thought I was going to go with The Flight Of The Bumble Bee, but one night, when Nancy was lying in my bed hogging my cover, Cancan came to my mind.
        It's better than The Flight Of Bumble Bee since I can use my image to match its rhythm(踩点) really well.
        And it's got comedy elements in it, even though it was written for very serious subjects.
        It's also the ed of the classic of our childhood favorite cartoon that Nancy never saw, Cookie Sheriff.
