        Thanks to this guy's brilliant performance, deep understanding of theoritical physics, and master-level AS/AE skill, we are able to make the idea that "each and everyone in the universe is a pivotal part of our world and a possibility of lives, shapes, and forms."
        He probably deserves more credits than we do.

        Artist that thrives under pressure, stress, and pain.
        It's an honor to have him starring our little production.

        The only camera crew that we had and the best we can have.
        Patiently listened through my scattered thoughts and scolded me for not giving her a happy ending.
        We love her.

        Chloe's Father
        <br>
        It was father's day that we shot most of the scenes. 
        He was being an angel and rendered us all the space we can have. 
        Thanks, dad, and Happy Father's Day.

        He featured our lowly production without question, even though we decided not to use that clip, it has nothing to do with his stage presentation.

        All the students in Calc AB class❤
        <br>
        I badgered everyone for their picture and everybody was super nice about it. 
        Our fellow classmates are all very coorporative and cute.
        Each and everyone of them represents a possibility to the future.
